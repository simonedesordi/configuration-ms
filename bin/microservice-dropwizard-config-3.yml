http:

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for service requests.
  # Because Java cannot drop privileges in a POSIX system, these
  # ports cannot be in the range 1-1024. A port value of 0 will
  # make the OS use an arbitrary unused port.
  port: 8380

  # The port on which the HTTP server listens for administrative
  # requests. Subject to the same limitations as "port". If this is
  # set to the same value as port, the admin routes will be mounted
  # under /admin.
